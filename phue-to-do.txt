PhueCmd - work to do

[ ] cmd line options:  --config file, --use-canned, --other options...,   
[ ] config file for hub key, known bulbs, 
[ ] config for wakeup seq, etc
[x] command mode - same as cmd line but w prompt loop, staying within PhueCmd

[ ] args & commands a big mess - shovel stuff into a Commander object
       this can hold ref to PhueSystem instead of passing it around
	this can have .running flag instead of global var
[ ] useless distinction between "simple" and "fancy" commands - merge the junk!
[ ] "any key" for wakeup, random 
[x] fix 'half' -- fixed itself after hacking in command mode :)
       but it appears to work only in command mode, not shell command line
[x] add 'wait' command (for command mode)
[ ] 'blink' command  (sketched in place, does nothing yet)
[ ] color code all bulbs: hub's bulb id, hubnum, system bulb id
[ ] wakeup time assumes tomorrow morning but ignore dates. Wait for post-midnight then watches  Should this be improved?
[ ] scan LAN for new hubs for system
[ ] hub scan for new bulbs. Remind: turn on/off bulbs wanted/not
[ ] random color gen: white avoidance, correlated color sets
[ ] curved transit path between keys in random 
[ ] Sequence, tracks not bulbs,  .play()  Use in wakeup, arb programmed lights
[ ] Assignment to assign bulbs to a track
[ ] Bulb groups. Have phuecmd 4000k apply only to one group, or all but one
[ ] main() to dlangui's Main
[ ] GUI for randomshow, trails on CIE map
[ ] GUI for wakeup?
[ ] or one massive gui for all functions?
