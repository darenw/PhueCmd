PhueCmd 
=======

(complete redo initiated 2023-Jan-06, replaces earlier PhueCmd repo)

WORK IN PROGRESS! Subject to change. Docs may be whacky out of date.

Command line program to do useful and fun things with Philips Hue light bulbs.
For now, Linux only.   Probably will work on other platforms since it's written in D
and doesn't do anything OS specific.


Planned features:
-----------------
* Capable of handling multiple hubs
* Wakeup mode for gradually bringing up lights in the morning, a fake sunrise.
* Sequences of bulb states for decorative displays, holiday use, theatrical use


Usage
-----
